        <h6 className="pb-3">The foundation and the beginnings..</h6>
        <p>
          In 1939, in the northern part of Hungary, embraced by the picturesque Black Mountain, a
          brave and wealthy group founded a club named &quot;The Door Club&quot;. Among the founders
          were influential businessmen, artists, and aristocrats who wanted to create a place where
          the privileged could gather to enjoy elegance and comfort.
          <br />
          <br />
          The club was established in a beautiful castle, once the estate of an old noble family.
          The castle boasted rich historical traditions and offered breathtaking views of the
          surrounding landscape.
          <br />
          <br />
          The founders&apos; aim was not only to create a luxury club but also a community center
          where people could come together to share their interests in arts, sports, and culture.
